# artx

Coming soon...


## Getting started

I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here. In order to get started, a good basic guide is [Getting Started with Node.js on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).

## The Development Stack

### Framework
ArtX is built off of the [NodeJS](http//www.nodejs.org) framework known as [Sails](http://sailsjs.org).

### Database
The current database is [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org). You can find out more about how to set up Postgres on Heroku at <https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#provisioning-the-add-on>. 

We are also using `sails-postgresql: "^0.10.9"` as the database adapter. You can learn more about Sails database adapters at ???

### Logging 

We are currently using [Papertrail]() for all of our logging purposes.

## The App
The current app is running at <http://artx.herokuapp.com>.


## Staging 

The current staging site is located at <http://artx-stage.herokuapp.com>.
